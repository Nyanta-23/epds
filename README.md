# Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling.

We’ve already laid the foundation — freeing you to create without sweating the small things.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have the [Server Requirements](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/installation) met.

Next, install via Composer:

    composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app

Or via the Laravel installer:

    laravel new example-app

After installation, please set your “APP_KEY” inside your .env file:

    php artisan key:generate

## Configuration & Deployment

For more information on configuring your application, please see the documentation at [https://laravel.com/docs/12.x](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x).

## License

The Laravel framework is open-source software licensed under the MIT license.
